## 1.Introduction

Welcome to the Agile Testing Sprint for our E-Commerce Website project! In this endeavor, we are tasked with enhancing our platform's functionality by integrating a new payment gateway and optimizing the product search feature, all within the confines of our agile development environment. As a test automation engineer, my role is pivotal in ensuring the seamless integration of these new features while safeguarding the stability of our existing functionalities.

Throughout this project, our primary objective is to develop and execute a suite of automated functional and regression tests. These tests will serve as a robust mechanism to validate that the introduced features meet the predefined acceptance criteria and do not disrupt the smooth operation of our platform.
